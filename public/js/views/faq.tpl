				<h3>What is a supercomputer?</h3>
				<p>Simply put it's a computer with exceptional compute capacity. With the exponential rate of Moore's Law over the last 50 years, the “exceptional” is an ever moving target. If you are interested in the historical progress of supercomputers, check out the TOP500 list. It includes all of the biggest machines from the present and past.</p>

				<h3>How much do supercomputers cost?</h3>
				<p>A lot! The most powerful computer today, the Chinese Tianhe-2 cost $390M to build, while the Japanese K computer cost over $1B.</p>

				<h3>How is supercomputer performance measured?</h3>
				<p>To perform well across a broad set interesting problems, a machine must have a balanced mix of computation, memory, and IO. The TOP500 list uses the LINPACK linear algebra benchmark created in the 1970s as a yard stick to compare performance. Another possibility is to simply look at peak performance numbers of the machines and quote things like GFLOPS and GigaBytes. A supercomputer should be measured on the ability to get the job done. The question is really “what job?”.</p>

				<h3>What is the fastest supercomputer today?</h3>
				<p> Based on the Top500 list, it is the Tianhe-2, a supercomputer developed by China’s National University of Defense Technology. It provides 33.86 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second) on the Linpack benchmark and includes over 3 Million CPU cores. </p>

				<h3>What is Parallella?</h3>
				<p> The Parallella is an open source credit card sized computer developed and manufactured in the USA by Adapteva and launched on Kickstarter in 2012. To date it has shipped to over 10,000 developers and 200 Universities. The computer has 18 CPU cores and at less than 5 Watts is arguably the most efficient computer in the world. </p>

				<h3>Does it run application 'X'?</h3>
				<p> The Parallella and Raspberry Pi both run standard Linux, so there is a good chance that it will if you upload the application to resin.io. However, note that most of today's legacy software was not written to take advantage of parallelism so you will likely have to do a fair amount of work to make the application run fast.</p>

				<h3>How is this different from  BOINC?</h3>
				<p> Popular distributed computing projects like BOINC and Folding@home were designed for standard desktop computers. A new generation of low power embedded computers like Parallella require a new approach that puts more emphasis on small size and ease of deployment. </p>

				<h3>How much does it cost to participate?</h3>
				<p> With the Parallella and Raspberry Pi both consuming less than 5 Watts at peak capacity, the cost of contributing compute capacity to the grid 24/7 365 days a year should be less than $5.</p>
